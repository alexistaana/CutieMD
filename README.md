## Inspiration
Have you ever been at home feeling really sick but not really knowing what to do about it? We did too, which is why
we believe CutieMD is a simple solution for your needs!

## What did we create?
An adorable little cutie who listens to what kind of illnesses you have, and offers solutions based on the urgency of your situation!

## How we built it.
WebMD is built as a web application built with HTML and JavaScript.

## Challenges we ran into
We incorporated a Natural Language Tool Kit library in python for sentiment handling but ran into difficulties
with calling a python script from javascript and retrieving the data back in the web application.

## What we have in store for CutieMD
Greater versatility in illnesses that CutieMD can handle, incorporation of a Medical API for symptom diagnosing,
and an option for livechat with a medical professional (medical professional not included).

## Built with:
Javascript, CSS, HTML, NodeJS

Submodule(s): Express
