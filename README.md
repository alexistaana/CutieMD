## A small cutie that is here to help you with your medical needs!!!

Notes:
- Medical symptoms will need to match as many similar words / ideas as possible & group it as a percentage
=> fatigue, fatigues, tired, tire, weak, etc.


- Groups of ideas may need to break down internally, 
	e.g. if flu is a symptom, we may need to internally see how much % of a flu that person has
		those symptoms will relate to flu, and if it's high enough / passes a threshold, then apply
